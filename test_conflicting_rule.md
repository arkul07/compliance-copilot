# EU Employment Law - Strict Termination Requirements

## Termination Notice Requirements

Under EU Directive 91/533/EEC and subsequent national implementations:

**Minimum Termination Notice Periods:**
- Employees with less than 5 years tenure: 60 days minimum
- Employees with 5-10 years tenure: 90 days minimum  
- Senior employees/managers: 120 days minimum
- Collective agreements may require longer periods

## Penalties for Non-Compliance
Contracts with insufficient termination notice periods are considered:
- Invalid termination clauses
- Potential unfair dismissal claims
- Employer liability for compensation
- Administrative fines up to â‚¬50,000

## Required Contract Language
Employment agreements MUST include:
"The employment relationship may NOT be terminated with less than [60/90/120] days written notice as required by EU Directive 91/533/EEC."

## Data Protection Requirements
All employment contracts involving personal data processing must include explicit GDPR consent mechanisms and data retention periods of no less than 7 years.
